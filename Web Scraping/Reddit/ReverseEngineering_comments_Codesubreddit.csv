0,gh1ewn6,t3_kk8xee,So the author knows Computer Science And Security in addition to biology and genetics that’s cool,t3_kk8xee
1,gh1g70z,t3_kk8xee,"This is crazy awesome, great find if you didn't write it. Great write up if you did!",t3_kk8xee
2,gh1lk0n,t3_kk8xee,How great is this? Fantastic article!,t3_kk8xee
3,gh1eg1a,t3_kk8xee,This was a fantastic read,t3_kk8xee
4,gh18l24,t3_kk8xee,This is so awesome. OP are you the author?,t3_kk8xee
5,gh2fddx,t3_kk8xee,Anyone know if selling a vaccine with that sequence would infringe intellectual property?,t3_kk8xee
6,gh311lh,t3_kk8xee,I am waiting for code comparison of two mRNA we have - Pfizer/BioNTech vs Moderna,t3_kk8xee
7,gh269n5,t3_kk8xee,"""The [people](https://twitter.com/goodwish916) that [discovered](https://twitter.com/KizzyPhD) this should be walking around high-fiving themselves incessantly.""

Thanks for sharing this!",t3_kk8xee
8,gh26t9y,t3_kk8xee,"Amazing article, thank a lot.",t3_kk8xee
9,gh28l2q,t3_kk8xee,"Wow, this is an amazing article!",t3_kk8xee
10,gh3413k,t3_kk8xee,"ok, DNA decompiler when? :D",t3_kk8xee
11,gh5xyuv,t3_kk8xee,"If you liked this (wonderful) article as I did, you will definitely enjoy these presentations by the same author:

12,gh2nwy0,t3_kk8xee,This is indeed awesome. The author's analogies using OS concepts are so clear. Does anyone know where I can find more of them?,t3_kk8xee
13,gh1vqs7,t3_kk8xee,amazing,t3_kk8xee
14,gh1xt2j,t3_kk8xee,"Wow, it's like machine language.",t3_kk8xee
15,gh22sei,t3_kk8xee,Really good!!!,t3_kk8xee
16,gh25byx,t3_kk8xee,Really great article!!,t3_kk8xee
17,ghhsj6p,t3_kk8xee,I wasn't this surprised for a long time. Great article!,t3_kk8xee
18,gnyxnok,t3_kk8xee,Awesome job,t3_kk8xee
19,gh233j3,t1_gh1ewn6,i'd kill to be proficient in one of those.,t3_kk8xee
20,gh2w0ee,t1_gh1ewn6,I took biotechnology class this semester its cool stuff. There are courses on coursera,t3_kk8xee
21,gjamec0,t1_gh1ewn6,"Damn polymaths, it's like come on guys save some of that talent for the rest of us XD",t3_kk8xee
22,gh23qzz,t1_gh18l24,"Nope, saw it [on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/powerdns_bert/status/1342568484946010116?s=21).",t3_kk8xee
23,gh2qfex,t1_gh2fddx,"Probably, because it is modified from what occurs naturally in a way that makes it original work. When the BRCA gene was discovered to be relevant to breast cancer, someone tried to patent it but was unable because it is already in everyone’s DNA! This vaccine code is a novel creation, so I would imagine it has IP protections.",t3_kk8xee
24,gq740uk,t1_gh2fddx,yep,t3_kk8xee
25,gh3vxfu,t1_gh3413k,"I've also sort of thought it would be cool to build a DNA fuzzer. Like I know it won't happen for a very very long time since we can't simulate these processes very well, but I'm sure we could find out so much just by rapidly trying things and observing the effects",t3_kk8xee
26,gh3ghv2,t1_gh3413k,That is what folding@home is,t3_kk8xee
27,gh27yvd,t1_gh233j3,Why not just study instead of killing,t3_kk8xee
28,gh3wys4,t1_gh3vxfu,"well I could imagine its possible for a given dna string:

- to detect decoded codons (easy)
- detect the known segments (cap, 5UTR, sig, polyA... dunno are there more?)
- 3UTR compare to other 3UTR's (as its not well known)
- decode the protein encoding part to its 3d representation (isnt this like evaluating a random solution of folding@home?)

if anyone has more information about this stuff or how to get into this field, id be really interested!",t3_kk8xee
